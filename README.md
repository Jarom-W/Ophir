  ## Description:

  Data is gold in the 21st century. For this reason, large data brokers like exchanges and news outlets charge enormous premiums to gain access to their data. While real-time quantitative data will remain expensive and gatekept, sentiment analysis remains a free source to understand the individuals that actually comprise the market.

Ophir seeks to provide open-source financial tools to help investors make the best financial decisions possible. Leveraging sentiments, fundamentals, technicals, historicals, and other data sources from every corner of the internet.

It also provides the ability for investors to create custom apps. For example, say a user wants to build an email newsletter that sends them updates and reminders based on their custom criteria. Ophir aims to make these tools easy to remove the guesswork and excessive Googling out of investing. Investing Openly.
